## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern:

- **Model**: `Habit` struct representing individual habits
- **View**: SwiftUI views for the user interface
- **ViewModel**: `HabitViewModel` class managing data and business logic

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger ViewModel methods
2. ViewModel updates the data model
3. Changes are automatically persisted to UserDefaults
4. Views reactively update based on ViewModel state

## Data Storage

The app uses `UserDefaults` for local data persistence:
- **Habits**: Stored as JSON-encoded array
- **History**: Stored as JSON-encoded dictionary mapping dates to completed habit IDs
- **Automatic Sync**: Data is saved immediately when changes are made

## Customization

### Adding New Features
The modular architecture makes it easy to extend:
- Add new habit properties in `Habit.swift`
- Implement new tracking logic in `HabitViewModel.swift`
- Create new views in the `Views/` directory

### Styling
The app uses SwiftUI's built-in styling with:
- System colors for consistency
- SF Symbols for icons
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
