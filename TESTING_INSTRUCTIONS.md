# 🧪 Testing Instructions for Habit History Feature

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Load Mock Data**: Tap the **green plus circle** button (⭕) in the top-right corner
2. **View History**: Tap the **clock icon** (⏰) in the top-left corner to see deleted habits
3. **Clear Data**: Tap the **red trash circle** button (🗑️) to reset everything

## 📊 What the Mock Data Includes

### Active Habits (4 habits)
- "Drink 8 glasses of water" - 30% completion rate
- "Read for 30 minutes" - 50% completion rate  
- "Exercise for 20 minutes" - 70% completion rate
- "Meditate for 10 minutes" - 90% completion rate

### Deleted Habits (5 habits with history)
- "Eat 1 apple" - deleted 15 days ago
- "Take vitamins" - deleted 8 days ago
- "Walk 10,000 steps" - deleted 22 days ago
- "Practice guitar" - deleted 5 days ago
- "Write in journal" - deleted 12 days ago

Each deleted habit has realistic completion patterns:
- **80% completion rate** in the last 3 days before deletion
- **60% completion rate** in the last week before deletion
- **40% completion rate** in the last 2 weeks before deletion
- **20% completion rate** earlier than that

## 🎯 Testing Scenarios

### 1. **Progress Bar Fix**
- Load mock data and check that progress bars show realistic percentages (not 400%)
- Try checking/unchecking habits and verify progress updates correctly

### 2. **Habit History View**
- Tap the clock icon to open history
- Expand each deleted habit to see completion dates
- Verify dates are formatted nicely (e.g., "Sep 15, 2025")
- Check that habits are sorted by deletion date (most recent first)

### 3. **Progress View - Month vs Year**
- Tap "View Progress" to open the progress view
- **Default View**: Should show current month with GitHub-style contribution grid
- **Month View**: 
  - See GitHub-style contribution grid (small colored squares)
  - Month name and completion stats at the top (e.g., "Sep 7/30")
  - Weekday headers (S M T W T F S) above the grid
  - Day numbers displayed above each contribution square
  - Each square represents a day with color-coded completion levels
  - Today is highlighted with blue border and white day number
  - Tap any square to see detailed progress
  - Use left/right arrows to navigate months
- **Year View**: 
  - Toggle to "Year" mode using the segmented control
  - See 12 month blocks arranged in a 3x4 grid
  - Each month block shows:
    - Month name (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
    - Completion count (e.g., "7/30" for September)
    - Weekday headers (S M T W T F S)
    - GitHub-style contribution squares for each day
  - Tap any day square to see detailed progress
  - Use year selector and navigation arrows

### 4. **Day Details with Archived Habits**
- Tap any day in the calendar to open "Day Details"
- **Progress Bar**: Now correctly shows percentage including archived habits
- **Active Habits**: Shows current habits with checkboxes (can be toggled)
- **Archived Habits**: Shows deleted habits that were completed on that day
  - Displayed below active habits
  - Shows with strikethrough text and grayed out
  - Has "Archived" badge
  - Always shows as completed (green checkmark)
- **Progress Calculation**: Includes both active and archived habits in the total

### 5. **Visual Indicators**
- Notice the red dot appears next to the clock icon when there are deleted habits
- The red dot disappears when you clear all data

### 6. **Data Persistence**
- Load mock data, close the app, reopen it
- Verify all data is still there
- Check that the history view still works

### 7. **Real Usage**
- Add your own habits
- Check them off on different days
- Delete some habits
- View their history in the clock icon view
- Switch between month and year views in progress
- Check day details to see archived habits
